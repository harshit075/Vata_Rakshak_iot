VATA_RAKSHAK - "TREE CUTTING ALERTING SYSTEM" 
Problem Statement: Uncontrolled forest fire and illegal deforestation for theft poses a significant threat to our environment and global sustainability.
EXISTING SOLUTION: The government is employing "conventional strategies" to curb  illegal deforestation. Through Zoning, From local people, Forest Management and  Monitoring, Drone-based identification, Public Awareness, Regulatory Enforcement 
PROPOSED SOLUTION: TREE CUTTING ALERTING SYSTEM 
 Saves valuable trees: The system helps in preserving trees by providing timely alerts on illegal activities. 
 Location Tagging of Assets: Each tree can be tagged and monitored individually, ensuring precise tracking. 
 Real-Time Tracking: Utilizes GPS and Google Maps for accurate, real-time tracking of tree locations. 
 Alerts & Alarm Reporting: Mobile applications provide instant alerts and alarms to  authorities in case of unauthorized activities. 
 Easy Installation: Sensors are easily attachable to trees and can be configured without much  hassle. 
 Forest Fire Detection: The system can also detect and alert about forest fires. 
 Reduction of Illegal Cutting: By alerting authorities about illegal tree cutting, the system effectively reduces such activities. 
 The system continuously monitors the trees for any suspicious activities. If the gyroscope detects 
 unusual movement or the smoke sensor detects smoke, the ESP8266 microcontroller processes this 
 data and sends an alert with the exact location (via the GPS module) to the authorities through a 
 mobile application. This methodology ensures a proactive approach to forest conservation and illegal 
 logging prevention. 
COST ESTIMATION:  
Common Price: The standard price for the tree-cutting alerting system is ₹3,000. This 
includes all essential components such as the ESP8266 microcontroller, gyroscope sensor, 
MQ2 smoke sensor, GPS Neo-6M module, solar panel, and 12V battery. 
Customized Pricing: For customers requiring additional features or customizations, the price 
will vary depending on their specific needs. Customization options can include enhanced 
sensors, extended battery life, additional connectivity options, or integration with other 
systems. 
Maintenance Cost: The system has a low maintenance cost of ₹50 per month. This cost 
covers routine checks and minor repairs to ensure the system operates efficiently and reliably 
over time.
